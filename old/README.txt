Libraries that have been removed from vxl (or lemsvxl) but may still be of use

These libraries are to be built as needed. We leave them here to be searchable
while developing new code.  If you need anything here, you become responsible to
make it build. You still need the main vxl repository in order to search the git
log for past changes to these libs.

Please use the same directory structure as VXL in case the lib comes from it

vil1/io, contrib/gel/vgel, etc: removed from main vxl in 2015/2016
