# Ideas to make it easier to work on VXL + VXD + internal Project

We call the superproject or monorepo VPE: Vision Programming Environment.
It would be a way of working in tandem, to try to make some things easier for
people that use and modify all of VXL and VXD and internal project at the source level.

The basic idea would be that the super repo would replicate a repo hierarchy
most VXD developers would have:

    vpe
      vxl
      vxd
      scripts
  
Here are some concrete ideas and Git experiments on how it could work out.

TL;DL : the conclusion is that:

- Our own scripting of a unified environment would work best
- **Main principle of good collaboration: keep in sync.** In practice, the principle of
  always having the working repos synced to master (and getting all layers
  promoted) is the new equivalent of making a tarball release. Striving to sync
  to master is much simpler than trying to share branches, though this may be
  needed for hacks and work arounds. Strive to fix 'master'! its a lot easier
  and imensely more useful than heavy strategies for propagating patches around.
- **Subtrees almost work** at the small scale of VPE, but still have problems with
  history which breaks regular git workflow. You simply can't even see the
  history inside vxl/ or vxd/ from vpe. But subtrees seem to be nice in that you
  can merge and track changes across the projects, and use regular git in the
  vast majority of useful cases. This is very cool.
- **Submodules complicate the regular git workflow** when we want to hack into the
  submodule.  It is well-defined, but requires a great deal of training. If
  people wouldn't hack into vxl all that much, and stay with top level changes,
  then it could work. But most people will hack away both vxl and vxd, and can't
  afford to lose changes. Submodules have some good ideas, though, such as
  vpe/ locking specific commits in vxl/ and vxd/ so that people that pull VPE get
  the same state in vxl/ and vxd/. Also, moving stuff across VPE/VXL/VXD doesn't
  really get tracked. Submodules are a monster whose overhead may pay off for
  projects requiring a huge number of repos for the developer to work on.
- **Android repo tool doesn't have good documentation**, and seems to demand that
  all sub repos be pulled from the same remote. It does bring some interesting ideas,
  such as having a manifest repository for meta-information of what repositories
  and branches the project uses/used for vxl/vxd etc at a particular commit.

# Requirements

## VPE
### Basic usage (99% of the time)
  Edit pattern

  - heavy edits to VXD
  - small edits or tweaks to VXL

  Share pattern
  
  - VXD edits and pushes done in agreed upon feature branches (curve-cues),
    merged often into master
  - less often: VXL small edits shared on VXL feature branches on a peer remote
    which is not the official one

  New collab working with the team needs to know
  - remote and feature branch to work in VXD
  - corresponding remote and patch branch to work in VXL

### Fairly common
  - Integrate to VXD master done by more experienced/more active peer

### Very rare
  - Integrate to VXL master done by more experienced/more active peer
  
# Internal/ LEMS

### Basic usage (99% of the time)
  Edit pattern

  - heavy edits to Internal
  - moderate edits to VXD
  - small edits or tweaks to VXL

  Share pattern
  
  - Internal edits and pushes done in agreed upon feature branches (new-sfm-system),
    merged often into master
  - VXD edits and pushes done in agreed upon feature branches (edge-improvement)
  - less often: VXL small edits shared on VXL feature branches on a peer remote
    which is not the official one (github/rfabbri branch compile-fix)
  - when some good feature is pushed, a pull request/email is sent
    - this fails when: 

    - Say vxl and vxd got an update of a few commits. You pulled in the updates,
      but no other person in the team did. 
    - At this point, everyone has an old vxl/ and vxd/ 
    - You make an edit to Internal, commit, tested and push.
        - case 1: you did send a pull request (rarely rappens in rapid Internal dev)
        - case 2: you did not tell all your peers about this push. After all, it
          was only a few commits.
    - If someone else updates, they may get a compile or unforeseen errors,
      because your Internal commits were tested against a slightly older vxl.
    - They may see the compile error was due to VXL, and go in and update VXL.
      But VXD is slightly off, too..
    
    Everyone run these risks in day to day programming.
    - VXD will be moderately high developed. So it will be out of sync
      constantly, because people mostly use git pull from Internal.

  New collab working with the team needs to know

  To bootstrap
  - remote and feature branch to work in Internal
  - remote and feature branch to work in VXD
  - corresponding remote and patch branch to work in VXL
  - extras (for new person):
      - establishing src/bin layouts
      - what other libs and system packages to install
      - what project-specific setup and utilities to install (aliases, mymake, switchpath, etc)

  To keep up (assuming he stopped for a while and didn't receive all pull requests)
  - git fetch each Internal
  - figure out from peers what are the branches they're working with
  - git update the branch



### Fairly common
  - Integrate to Internal master done quite often (people tend integrate and push to
    master in my experience, when they take ownership of the repo)
  - Integrate to VXD master done by more experienced/more active peer

### Very rare
  - Integrate to VXL master done by more experienced/more active peer
  

# Subtrees for VPE

We're in VPE, and want to add VXD and VXL

## Adding plugin example from [2], for reference

    git remote add plugin ../remotes/plugin
    git fetch plugin
    git read-tree --prefix=vendor/plugins/demo -u plugin/master
    git commit -m "Added demo plugin subtree in vendor/plugins/demo"

## Adding VXL to VPE

    git remote add vxl ../remotes/vxl
    git fetch vxl
    git read-tree --prefix=vxl -u vxl/master # an alternative would be -u vxl-master
    git commit -m "Added vxl subtree in vxl/"
    git checkout -b vxl-master vxl/master  # keeps vxl history across git clones
    git push origin vxl-master

## Adding VXD to VPE
    git remote add vxd ../remotes/vxd
    git fetch vxd
    git read-tree --prefix=vxd -u vxd/master
    git commit -m "Added vxd subtree in vxd/"
    git checkout -b vxd-master vxd/master  # keeps vxd history across git clones
    git push origin vxl-master

## Pulling in changes from VXL

    git fetch vxl
    git merge -s subtree vxl/master  # this will join histories
    # git merge -X subtree=vxl/ vxl/master  # if the above goes crazy
    # git merge -s subtree --squash vxl/master # this will not join, untraceable
    # git commit -m "FROM VXL: update"
    git checkout vxl-master  # just to make it point to the right place
    git merge vxl/master
    git checkout master
    git push origin vxl-master

## Pulling in changes from VXD

    git fetch vxd
    git merge -s subtree vxd/master  # this will join histories
    # git merge -X subtree=vxd/ vxd/master  # if the above goes crazy
    # git merge -s subtree --squash vxd/master # this will not join, untraceable
    # git commit -m "FROM VXD: update"
    git checkout vxd-master  # just to make it point to the right place
    git merge vxd/master
    git checkout master
    git push origin vxd-master

## Making changes to VXL/VXD within VPE

### Checked out VPE fresh, made changes to VXL, Push upstream to VXL
When VPE is checked out, VXL's remote is not there. Add it if you want to
push/pull directly without passing through VPE

    git remote add ...

    In VPE we'll have booststrap/setup scripts for this.

### VXL/VXD change flow
Edit vxl/ normally

    # eg:  echo '// test' >> vxl/CMakeLists.txt   # an existing VXL file is edited
    # if we want that change to be backported to VXL, we prepend TO VXL:
    git ci -am "VPE->VXL: cmakelists"  # this message shows up on upstream
    # Or, if we forgot, we can tag the commit "TO-VXD"

Keep doing other commits to anywhere in the tree.  When backporting, we have to
cherry-pick when the original team has made free commits anywhere in the tree.
If you yourself are working on the tree, and separate your commits to vxl/ and
vxd/ folders in separate branches merged to your master, this becomes a rebase
instead of cherrypicking (see similar approach 2 below).

    git checkout vxl-master
    # usually works: 
    # git cherry-pick -x --strategy=subtree master
    # safer and more consistent:
    git cherry-pick -x --strategy=subtree -Xsubtree=vxl/ master

    # check if that generates a commit with the wrong prefix, if so,
    # undo the commit by resetting HEAD and give up.

    # use '-e' flag to cherry-pick to edit the commit message before passing upstream

    # --strategy=subtree (-s means something else in cherry-pick) also helps to make sure
    # changes outside of the subtree (elsewhere in container code) will get quietly
    # ignored. 

    # if merging, use the same strategies.
    #
    # the -x in these commands annotate the commit message with the SHA1 of VPE
    # Use the following to make sure files outside of the subtree (elsewhere in container code) 
    # will get quietly ignored. This may be useful when cherypicking a rename, since move is rm+add

    git push  # to push the vxl-master branch
    git push vxl HEAD:master

### Original example on which the above is based, showing the kinds of edits
    echo '// Now super fast' >> vendor/plugins/demo/lib/index.js
    git ci -am "[To backport] Faster plugin"
    date >> main-file-1
    git ci -am "Container-only work"
    date >> vendor/plugins/demo/fake-work
    date >> main-file-2
    git ci -am "[To backport] Timestamping (requires container tweaks)"
    echo '// Container-specific' >> vendor/plugins/demo/lib/index.js
    git ci -am "Container-specific plugin update"

## VXL/VXD -> VPE file move within VPE

    Works, just integrate the commit to VXL/VXD as the above directions for making
    any other type of change.

    History tracing:

## VPE -> VXL/VXD file move within VPE
    Works, just integrate the commit to VXD as the above directions for making
    any other type of change.

    History tracing:

## VXD -> VXL file move within VPE
    Works, just integrate the commit to VXD and VXL as the above directions for making
    any other type of change.

    History tracing:
  

## Remove VXD or any subtree

It’s just a directory in your repo. A good ol’ git rm will do.

    git rm -r vxl
    git commit -m "Removing vxl subtree"
    git remote rm vxl

    # perhaps optimzie git / todo: test tree size
    git gc  # repo still huge
    git gc --prune=now --aggressive  # till, 103M!


## History lookup

    git log --follow filename

This will show all logs, including renames and moves. It doesn't work
across subtrees, but is being fixed by the Git team [5].
If you use the subtree variant below, it works a bit better.

    git log -- '*filename'          # from the toplevel

This views each commit that touched a file whose name ends with filename. It
won't follow actual renames, and may show false positive if you have several
files with the same basename [1].

## Caveats
- problem 1: history of subtree not visible with git log. This is under
  development by the Git team for `git log --follow`.

## Benefits
The toplevel VPE team can edit any submodule and propagate changes to VPE peers,
using regular git workflow. The vxl-master and vxd-master branches track where
we are at these subprojects. Once in a blue-moon, we push to the subprojects.

Worst case scenario:
If we need to heavily sync to the subproject-specific remotes, two cases:

1. Experienced users (1 or 2 people in team)
Pushing often to the subproject is infeasible
- We'll make wild commits in VPE on a branch, push to VPE regularly.
- Once in a good while, we carefully push to the subproject.

2. Collaborators which only care to know regular Git (most of team)
- Work normally on VPE and push changes done everywhere in the repo to VPE
- Never update submodule directly; rely on experienced users to do so.
- Pulling in an updated VXL necessarily relies on VPE remote having done so.
  They will never do this independently. They rarely do anyways. If they really
  want to do so, then they learn how to do it. Which means we make it difficult
  (but far from impossible) for them to diverge from the VPE team on which VXL
  or VXD is being used.

# VPE repository as scripts over regular Git
A script that builds the VPE environment for a beginner or collaborator.
Something very much along the lines of https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all

- creates everything in a toplevel vpe/ folder
- pulls in all repos, including recommended utility ones (utils-macambira and boost sources if need be)
- mkdir all bin 
- does an apt-get or port install for common packages
- install common sh aliases and git aliases
- moves between repos are history-tracked only by being disciplined and including the
  origin SHA1 in every cherrypick or merge
- have a bin/ or scripts/ subfolder for scripts
- to share your dev environment:
  - integrate and push to master in each, or:
  - push each to a separate branch in person's github for each
  - write in the vpe-build script or config file the corresponding branches
  - send the script to the person.
- one could have a "share" script which would go inside a separate or father
  repo, look up the SHA1 and currently checked out branch of the checked-in
  repos, and upload that. This little repo or file would track people's history
  of branches, and it could be user-specific, just so other people know where
  you were when you comitted.

Advantages
- current people keep working as is, just adding VXD to the loop
  
Locking commits and branches for sub-projects for sharing
  - separate repositories can achieve this by:
    - setting up a post-commit hook to write the commit SHA of the submodules to
      the parent repo. (basically, the .gitmodules is the actual good thing, to
      let users know what the maintainer is using).
    - the maintainer could have a script: mark-as-build, to populate a file with
      the id of the commit of the dependant repos plus the remote and branches being used (ouch).

# Subtree variant for VPE
This follows link [5]'s alternative in the response therein.

## Adding vxl/vxd to vpe

    git init
    > deleteme.txt
    git add .
    git commit -m 'initial dummy commit'

    git remote add -f vxl ../remotes/vxl
    # tested with git 2.10
    git merge --allow-unrelated-histories vxl/master

    git rm deleteme.txt
    git commit -m 'cleaning up initial file'
    mkdir vxl
    git mv `ls|grep -v vxl` vxl
    git commit -m 'moved vxl to vxl/ folder'

    # do the same for vxd
    git remote add -f vxd ../remotes/vxd
    # tested with git 2.10
    git merge --allow-unrelated-histories vxd/master
    mkdir vxd
    git mv `ls|grep -v vxd | grep -v vxl` vxd
    git commit -m 'moved vxd to vxd/ folder'

    # histories look perfect

## Pulling in changes from VXL/VXD

    # do it in steps to make sure whats going on
    git fetch vxl
    git merge -s recursive vxl-master -Xsubtree=vxl vxl/master    # vxl/anybranch
    git checkout master
    git merge vxl-master
    git push origin vxl/master

    # you could also just merge directly!
    git fetch vxl
    git merge -s recursive -Xsubtree=vxl vxl/master

## Updating the remote
### 1. Make edits
    # Edit vxl/ normally

    # eg:  echo '// test' >> vxl/CMakeLists.txt   # an existing VXL file is edited
    # if we want that change to be backported to VXL, we prepend TO VXL:
    git ci -am "VPE->VXL: cmakelists"  # this message shows up on upstream
    # Or, if we forgot, we can tag the commit "TO-VXD"

Keep doing other commits to anywhere in the tree.  When backporting, we have to
cherry-pick when the original team has made free commits anywhere in the tree.
If you yourself are working on the tree, and separate your commits to vxl/ and
vxd/ folders in separate branches merged to your master, this becomes a rebase
instead of cherrypicking (see similar approach 2 below).

### 2. Cherrypick/Rebase edits
    git fetch vxl
    git checkout -b vxl-integration vxl-master
    git checkout vxl-integration
    # merge changes from master using subtree
    git cherry-pick -x --strategy=subtree -Xsubtree=vxl/ master
    # check if that generates a commit with the wrong prefix, if so,
    # undo the commit by resetting HEAD and give up, start again.
    #
    # --strategy=subtree (-s means something else in cherry-pick) also helps to make sure
    # changes outside of the subtree (elsewhere in container code) will get quietly
    # ignored. 

    # use '-e' flag to cherry-pick to edit the commit message before passing upstream
    # you may want to say something about it if it was a move from another package
    #
    # the -x in these commands annotate the commit message with the SHA1 of VPE
    # Use the following to make sure files outside of the subtree (elsewhere in container code) 
    # will get quietly ignored. This may be useful when cherypicking a rename, since move is rm+add

    # Or, if you organized your VXL commits directly into eg vxl-integration, just rebase

    git branch master-reb master # master or any other branch tip to rebase
    git rebase -s subtree -Xsubtree=vxl --onto vxl-integration feature-in-progress master-reb
    git checkout vxl-integration
    git merge master-reb

## 3. Push edits

    # double-check your vxl-master commits look good and linear

    git push  # to push the vxl-master branch to toplevel VPE
    git push vxl HEAD:master
    git branch -D master-reb

    Rebase is nice, since rebasing interactively means that you have a chance to
    edit the commits which are rebased (inserting move-related info such as the
    origin sha1 etc). You can reorder the commits, and you can
    remove them (weeding out bad or otherwise unwanted patches).

### Conclusion
- same as before

- Caveat: git log --follow doesn't work for sub folders to trace down to the orig repo

- mere users only push to main repo, but will never ever push directly to the
  subrepos, unless they are advanced users. this may be a good thing, as
  day-to-day workflow gets centralized and synced a lot easier (one repo) than
  before.


# Submodules for VPE
- well supported
- bad: all users need to learn a lot of submodule lingo
- good: if the repo maintainer updates the sub-repos and pushes, users are
  locked to that sub-repo version.
  - If your peers do a mere git pull, it will pull-in the work VXL.
  - If your peers update vxl, everyone gets vxl
  - In that way, vxl is updated equally for everyone in the team,
  instead of each pulling a different vxl master. You sync to the team repo,
  rather than to the vxl team repo.
  (? can we track multiple versions of vxl?)
- in the simple use case of only editing and pushing to the container repo,
  naive users may not be aware vxl/ folders are not separate git repos
- basically the workflow has no base case for simple usage. It is always going
  to be complex
- advantage: much more well-defined and well-maintaned than subtrees if you
  know the lingo
- advantage: for advanced users it may provide a good way to share code in a
  predictable way, locking the subprojects to the commits that people are
  working at the moment.

Submodules differ from subtrees:
- submodules are separate git repositories inside a a bigger one, yet are not
  managed as usual git repositories within the bigger one. 
  - git log works nicely, with separate histories for each
- subtrees look more like a subfolder uniformly managed by git, but with tiny annoying quirks

- for submodules, collaborators won't automatically see updates to submodules—if
  you update a submodule, you may need to remind your colleagues to run git
  submodule update or they will likely see odd behavior.


For VPE, submodules are not attractive since:
- people's usual git workflow is broken
- commits made to sub projects may be lost.


##  Pulling in changes from VPE

    git spull   # alias or script. reminds me of the scripted superrepo approach

    git pull
    git submodule update     # always.. massive danger if you don’t, as 
                             # your next container commit will regress the submodule

#### If the submodule url changed, everyone has to:
    git pull
    git submodule sync
    git submodule update     # always.. massive danger if you don’t, as 
                             # your next container commit will regress the submodule

Spull alias cover all cases:

    git config --global alias.spull '!git pull && git submodule sync --recursive && git submodule update --init --recursive'

##  Pulling in changes from VXL/VXD

    cd vxl
    git fetch
    git merge origin/master
    cd .. 
    git diff --submodule 
    # you can see that the submodule was updated and get a list of commits that were added to it. 

    git commit -am
    git push
   

## Updating VXL/VXD within VPE

    # first, make sure update submodule master to remote master,
    # or, more generally, that you have a branch tracking the submodule

    cd vxl

    git status      # it will show detached state
    git checkout vxl-master     # if it doesn't exist, create it
    git merge origin/master

    # if you don't want to use that branch, create any other, as long as you are
    # inside the submodule, branches will be local.

    # Now make your changes and commit normally, within vxl/
    git push origin vxl-master

    cd ..

    # Part 2:  update VPE's repo to see if we have other branches or our own
    # vxl-master updated in VPE's repo
    git submodule update --remote --merge

    # If you forget the --rebase or --merge, Git will just update the submodule
    # to whatever is on the server and reset your project to a detached HEAD state.
    # Then you have to checkout vxl-master again and redo the work

    # on the toplevel, you won't use git push, but first
    git push --recurse-submodules=check

# Guidelines
- always upgrade git. use > 2

# Ideas
Some things to think about

- How do people actually manage changes across multiple Git repositories? Do we really have to do it all by hand?
- There could be a tool that tracks code that was moved across Git repositories.
  It could have some minimal functionality:
  - If you tag a move/git tree surgery by including in the commit of the
    destination repo the original repo SHA1, it could automatically detect code
    branching intra repository, or at least mark on the original repository code
    that has gone to another repository and where. A tool such as this must already exist!
  - There should be something like `git mv` across repositories, which
    automatically does the surgery of the history, even though this might not
    always be desired when moving code from Internal to a public one.

- In the future, VXD could be a sub module of VXL, and VXL would have a CMAKE
  flag BULD_VXD which is off by default.
  - VXD bundling VXL as a submodule

- [Google and Facebook are working on scaling up Mercurial and making it available.](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/google-2-billion-lines-codeand-one-place/) Perhaps we are outgrowing Git, and just have to wait to do things right.
