/*! \mainpage vsl : Streaming Library for Binary I/O
* This library provides classes and functions to save all common types and containers
* to a binary stream.
*
* All objects in VXL should be able to save themselves to a stream (eg a file) and
* restore (load) themselves from a stream (file).
*
* The main functions provided for this purpose are
* - vsl_b_write(os,object);
* - vsl_b_read(is,object&);
*
* \section Lead Developer
* Ian Scott is responsible for co-ordinating significant changes to vsl.
