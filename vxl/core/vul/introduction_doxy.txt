/*! \mainpage vul : Utility Library
* All C++ programs need a few basic utilities, and all C++ programmers write their own
* at some point. The things included in vul are not considered any better or worse
* than the several other libraries available, but they are consistently named and
* lightweight.
*
* The key elements of this library are:
* - vul_file
* - vul_directory : File handling utilities, directory reading
* - vul_arg : Parse command-line arguments conveniently.
* - vul_redirector :  Simplify redirection of standard output/error
* - vul_awk : Read text files, breaking each line into fields.
* - vul_reg_exp : Regular expression matching.
*
* \section Lead Developer
* Fred Wheeler is responsible for co-ordinating significant changes to vul.
