/*! \mainpage vgl : Geometry Library
*
* The core geometry library vgl is intended to provide an environment for geometric
* primitives, both in cartesian and homogeneous representations, and for both 2D and 3D.
*
*This includes classes for
*
* - Points, lines and planes.
* - 2D conics.
* - Rectangular bounding boxes.
* - Polygons.
* - Direction vectors.
* - Region scan iterators.
*
*In addition, the vgl-algo library contains functions to perform elementary geometric
*operations like intersecting two lines, finding the nearest point on a line or a conic,
*computing the cross ratio of four points, lines or planes.
*
* For convenience, this functionality is put in a "name space", separate for 2D and 3D,
* and separate for cartesian and homogeneous representations.
*
* All representation classes are templated on the computational numeric type.
*
* \section Lead Developer
* Peter Vanroose is responsible for co-ordinating significant changes to vgl.
