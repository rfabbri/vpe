/*! \mainpage vbl : Basic Template Library
* Several generally useful classes.
*
* All C++ programs need a few basic utilities, and all C++ programmers write their
* own at some point. The things included in vbl are not considered any better or
* worse than the several other libraries available, but they are consistently named
* and lightweight.
*
* The key elements of this library include:
* - vbl_smart_ptr : Reference counted smart pointers for any class that defines ref and unref.
* - vbl_triple : Three element version of vcl_pair.
* - vbl_array_2d : A simple two dimensional array
* - vbl_array_3d : A simple three dimensional array
* - vbl_sparse_array_2d : A simple two dimensional sparse array
* - vbl_sparse_array_3d : A simple three dimensional sparse array
*
* \section Lead Developer
* Fred Wheeler is responsible for co-ordinating significant changes to vbl.
