Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

1) How do I get stuff to appear on the main page of the Doxygen output?

Add a file called <introduction_doxy.txt> to your library.
For example, the one in vnl looks like this:

    // The following text is included in the main documentation page by doxygen
    /*! \mainpage vnl : Numeric Library
    * The numerics library, vnl is intended to provide an environment for numerical
    * programming which combines the ease of use of packages like Mathematica and
    * Matlab with the speed of C and the elegance of C++.
    * It provides a C++ interface to the high-quality Fortran routines made available
    * in the public domain by numerical analysis researchers.
    *
    * This release includes classes for
    * - Matrices and Vectors (including specialised classes for particular forms)
    * - Matrix decompositions
    * - Polynomials
    * - Optimization
    * - Common functions (in vnl_math)
    */

2) How do I get a brief description of my library to appear on the main index page?

Add the <introduction_doxy.pl> file to your library (see (1) above).
The gen_doxy_index.pl tool looks for the text following \mainpage and uses
that on the index page.

3) Under Windows I keep getting an error about not finding gswin32.exe. How do I fix it?

The full error is "Cannot find the file 'gswin32.exe' (or one of its components). Make sure the path and filename are correct and that all required libraries are available."

Doxygen is looking for ghostscript to render mathematical equations in the documentation. See http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ for more details. You need to make sure that gswin32 is in your search path. For example on my computer I would type
>set path=c:\progra~1\ghostv~1\gs6.01\bin;%path%
before running update_webserver.pl

4) How do I get images into the texi books?

Add the following line to the location in your texi file you want the image to appear

@image{image_name,,1in}

image_name should be the filename (minus the .suffix) of your image. Put your jpeg, png, or eps image (with the correct .suffix) in the same directory as the texi file. The gen_books.pl script in the documentation system will automatically copy and transform the image files to the appropriate place and format for display in the output webpage.
