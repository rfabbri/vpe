#     After CMake version 2.6, the variables:
#     -CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
#     -CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
#     -CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
#     should be used instead of
#     -EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH and
#     -LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH.
#     
#     from the cmake 2.6 documentation:
#     https://cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake2.6docs.html#variable:EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH
#     
#     EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH: Old executable location variable.
#     This variable should no longer be used as of CMake 2.6. Use the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target property instead. It will override this variable if it is set.
#     
#     If set, this is the directory where all executables built during the build process will be placed.
#     
#     LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH: Old library location variable.
#     This variable should no longer be used as of CMake 2.6. Use the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target properties instead. They will override this variable if they are set.
#     
#     If set, this is the directory where all the libraries built during the build process will be placed.
