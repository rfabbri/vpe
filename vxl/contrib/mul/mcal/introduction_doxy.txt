/*! \mainpage mcal: Manchester's Component Analysis Library
* Provides several classes for computing various linear components of sets
* of vectors.
*
* For instance, mcal_pca performs Principle Component Analysis
*
* The mcal_general_ca generates a set of orthogonal axes so as to
* minimise some cost function based on the axes and the projection
* onto them, encoded in classes derived from mcal_single_basis_cost.
*
* One can perform a version of Sparse PCA by plugging a
* mcal_sparse_basis_cost object into the mcal_general_ca.
