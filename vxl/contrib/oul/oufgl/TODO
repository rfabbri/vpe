TODO for oufgl
--------------

In no particular order:

- add support for video-for-windows stuff
- fix up asynchronous stuff for v4l
- add colour capture to v4l (actually this should be fairly easy)
- convert over to vil from vil1
- perhaps add new controllers into the top level directory such as
pan/tilt/zoom etc.
- add more control in for different colour spaces etc
