/*! \mainpage rrel : Robust Estimation Library
* The robust estimation library provides various classes for robust
* estimation of parameters. The library design is based on three
* concepts: the problem, the objective function, and the search
* technique. The problem involves that data and the model. Examples of
* problems include linear regression and 2D homography estimation. The
* objective function measures the "cost" of a solution, and is
* minimized. The objective function is a function of the residuals
* (and perhaps of the scale). The search technique is that which is
* used to minimize the objective function for the given
* problem. Currently implemented are IRLS (iteratively re-weighted
* least squares) and random sampling.
