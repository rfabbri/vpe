/*! \mainpage vepl : Easy Image Processing Library with vil
* This library essentially just provides wrappers around the templated IP
* classes of the \c vipl library, but limited to images of type
* \c vil_image_view<T> .
*
* For every class in \c vipl , there is a function in \c vepl with the same
* name (after substituting "vipl" by "vepl"), which returns a
* \c vil_image_resource_sptr, whose first argument is a \c vil_image_resource_sptr,
* (the input image), and where the possible extra arguments are identical to
* the arguments of the constructor of the corresponding \c vipl class.
*
* To get an idea of how to use these functions, have a look at the example
* programs in \c tbl/vepl/examples/ .  The examples are worked out, in the
* sense that they also take care of loading and saving the images and possibly
* reading the filter parameters from standard input.  Ignoring this, the use of
* a particular IP filter is just a single line: e.g.:
* \verbatim
*   vil_image_resource_sptr im1 = vil_load_image_resource("filename");
*   vil_image_resource_sptr im2 = vepl_gradient_mag(im1);
*   vil_image_resource_sptr im3 = vepl_median(im2, 1.5); // median filter with radius 1.5
*   vil_image_resource_sptr im4 = vepl_threshold(im3, 59,0,255); // binary clipping at 59
*   vil_save_image_resource(im4, "edges_image.pgm"); // type "pnm" deduced from file extension
* \endverbatim
