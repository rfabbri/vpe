/*! \mainpage vil1 : Imaging Library
*
* NOTE: This library has now been superceeded by the new vil.
*
* vil1 provides flexible and powerful  access to all 2D images,
* including those too large to fit in the address space of a single program or process.
*
* This goal must be achieved, however, without affecting the speed or complexity of
* the much more common case of programs which can read all their images into main memory
* and process them in-core. In fact, both cases need similar treatment: even
* in-core images are assumed to be sufficiently large (say a megabyte) that special
* care must be taken to avoid unnecessary copying of their data. In both cases, the normal
* requirements of efficiency and ease-of-use apply.
*
* The system must allow:
*
* - Fast access to images on disk, at no more than a 10% speed penalty for operations on images in memory.
* - Fast loading of subsets of the image data.
* - Efficient access to the native image layout.
* - Efficient memory management, both automatic and programmer-mediated.
*
* The vxl image library is an evolutionary rewrite of the TargetJr Image library.
