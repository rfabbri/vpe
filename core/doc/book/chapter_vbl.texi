The STL isn't perfect. vbl provides some of the missing classes.

All C++ programs need a few basic utilities, and all C++ programmers write
their own at some point.  The things included in vbl are not considered any
better or worse than the several other libraries available, but they are
consistently named and lightweight.  The key elements of this library
are:

@deffn {class template} @code{vbl_smart_ptr}
Reference counted smart pointers for any class that defines @code{ref} and
@code{unref}.
@end deffn

@deffn class @code{vbl_triple}
Three element version of @code{vcl_pair}.
@end deffn

@deffn class @code{vbl_array_2d}
A simple two dimensional array
@end deffn

@deffn class @code{vbl_sparse_array_2d}
A simple two dimensional sparse array
@end deffn
